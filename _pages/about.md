<!---
I am a recently graduated Master's student from the David R. Cheriton School of Computer Science at the University of Waterloo in Ontario, Canada. I completed my degree under the supervision of Dr. Anita Layton and Dr. Justin Wan. My interests mainly lie in AI, Computer Vision, Privacy, and Computational Medicine.

I previously received my B.Sc. in Honours Computer Science at the University of British Columbia (2017-2021). My final thesis was on federated image preprocessing.

Currently looking for a position in AI, data science or privacy research! Feel free to reach out to me at chrisjwest99@gmail.com for further discussion.

As a recent graduate of the David R. Cheriton School of Computer Science at the University of Waterloo in Ontario, Canada, I bring with me a strong foundation in computer science and a deep understanding of AI, Computer Vision, Privacy, and Computational Medicine. Under the guidance of my supervisors, Dr. Anita Layton and Dr. Justin Wan, I successfully completed my Master's degree in September of 2023. The main focus of my research was on spatial parameterization schemes for renal tumor distribution.

Prior to my Master's, I obtained my B.Sc. in Honours Computer Science from the University of British Columbia (2017-2021), culminating in a final thesis on federated image preprocessing using a mutual information metric.

I will be starting a new role as a Data Scientist at Canadian Nuclear Labs as of July 2024. I welcome any opportunities for collaboration or discussion, and can be reached at chrisjwest99@gmail.com.
