I'm a graduate student at the David R. Cheriton School of Computer Science at the University of Waterloo in Ontario, Canada. I work with Dr. Anita Layton and Dr. Justin Wan on various topics, mainly focusing on medical applications of computer science techniques. I also have interests in computer vision, machine+deep learning and privacy.

I previously recieved my B.Sc. in Honours Computer Science at the University of British Columbia.
