title: "CantoRead"
citation: 'A standalone reader for written Cantonese. Includes Jyutping, definitions and example sentences extracted from the <a href="https://words.hk/">Words.hk</a> online dictionary and converted into JSON format (included with build). Future builds will focus on text analysis (like in <a href="https://www.chinesetextanalyser.com/">Chinese Text Analyzer</a>), improved dictionary coverage, pre-downloaded learning resources and beautification. Built as a passion project from my love of the Cantonese language and language learning in general. Current build (Sept 2021) is unstable but this excerpt will be updated with link to repo with first full release.'
