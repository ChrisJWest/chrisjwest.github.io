title: "CantoTools"
citation: 'A suite of tools to help language learners learn Cantonese. This is one of my favorite languages and has almost no resources publicly available. On top of this, year after year it is becoming an increasingly endangered language. Included is CantoRead, a standalone reader for written Cantonese. Includes Jyutping, frequency information and definitions extracted from the <a href="https://words.hk/">Words.hk</a> online dictionary (included with build). Also includes persistent bookmark and known word storage. Future builds will focus on text analysis (like in <a href="https://www.chinesetextanalyser.com/">Chinese Text Analyzer</a>), improved dictionary coverage, pre-downloaded learning resources and beautification (still very basic). Also as part of CantoTools is YTCantoParse, a Colab-powered interactive application to scrape Cantonese youtube videos from an offline spreadsheet and present word frequency analysis. Can integrate with Migaku word dictionary information. Link to the repo: <a href="https://github.com/ChrisJWest/CantoTools/tree/main">CantoTools</a>)'
